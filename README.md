| 1   | Identify potential packages to extract | To reuse existing code and reduce development time    | Review existing codebase and identify reusable code. Prioritize packages based on potential impact and usefulness.                                                                     | Low        |
| 2   | Extract and modularize packages        | To make code easily consumable by other projects      | Extract identified packages into separate modules. Publish on package repository like Pub.dev. Ensure good documentation and examples.                                                 | Medium     |
| 3   | Integrate static analysis tools        | To ensure code quality and maintainability            | Evaluate and integrate tools like SonarQube, Lint, and Flutter analyze into development process. Configure tools to run automatically on continuous integration and delivery pipeline. | High       |
| 4   | Create a white-label application       | To showcase packages and APIs and encourage usage     | Create a Flutter application that showcases packages and APIs. Make sure application has good documentation and examples, and can be easily customized.                                | High       |
| 5   | Make packages open source              | To encourage community contributions and feedback     | Publish packages on GitHub and make them open source. Encourage community contributions and engagement.                                                                                | Low        |
| 6   | Community outreach                     | To promote packages and APIs to the Flutter community | Promote packages and APIs through social media, blog posts, and developer forums. Encourage feedback and contributions from other developers.                                          | Medium     |
| 7   | Continuous improvement                 | To ensure packages and APIs meet the needs of users   | Continuously review and improve packages and APIs based on feedback from the community and usage metrics. Monitor usage statistics and prioritize feature requests.                    | High       |
